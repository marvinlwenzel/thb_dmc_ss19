# THB Data Mining Collection 
This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts for the Data Mining Course of the University of Applied Sciences Brandenburg (Technische Hochschule Brandenburg in German - short *THB*). 

I do not guarantee that anything here is correct. I get practice coding this, you might get some help, or something to laugh at, who knows? `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
